Theme Test Drive is by Vladimir Prelovac (http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/)
If Theme Test Drive is installed THEME SWITCHING WILL NOT WORK

In Apperance->JP THEME BAR you can specify the following settings:
"Label For Theme Bar" - The text that will preceded the list of themes. For example, "Switch Themes."
Each installed theme can be optionally enabled as an option to switch to.
"Background Colour" - Background colour for the theme switch bar.
"Text Colour" - Text colour for the theme switch bar.
"Label Background Colour" - Background colour for the label section.
"Label Text Colour" - Text colour for the label.

Below these options is a preview. It is not accurate, as it is busted. Sorry. Will fix later.
