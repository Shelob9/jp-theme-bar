JP Theme Switcher
=================
A WordPress plugin that adds a theme switcher / theme demo bar to the bottom of your site to allow users to switch the theme they see on your site.

This plugin requires the plugin Theme Test Drive (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-test-drive/)
Theme Test Drive is by Vladimir Prelovac (http://www.prelovac.com/vladimir/)
If Theme Test Drive is installed THEME SWITCHING WILL NOT WORK


Status and TODO
===============
* Works on front-end.

* Admin works but, preview is busted. Also needs layout improved and admin functions need to be moved into a class.

* I plan to add options for moving to the top of the page. Currently it is at the bottom beacuse that is where I needed it.

* I also plan to put the theme options into a pull-down or pull-up list.

* I might add an option to hide or minimize the bar, not really sure.
